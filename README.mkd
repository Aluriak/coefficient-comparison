# Comparison of set similarity coefficients

Dice and Jaccard differences for sets similarity computation now described graphically:

![dice and jaccard comparison](https://github.com/Aluriak/coefficient-comparison/blob/master/results_50measure_100setsize.png)

Run the computations:

    make
    
    

Take a look to `__main__.py` file and the first lines to change constants about measure point and sets size.

Need pandas and matplotlib:

    pip install -r requirements
